CSC 344 - Spring 2021
Programming Exercise 2

Your objective for this assignment is to write an assembly function that given a pointer to the base of an array of integer values and an integer count of the number of elements in the array will return the mean of the values in that array as the functionâ€™s return result.

In C the prototype for this function would appear as:

int average(int *array, int num_elts);


For this assignment you DO NOT need to input the array of integers. You are welcome to use a couple of statically initialized arrays declared in the data segment as the argument passed to your function.

My goal with this assignment is to give you something that you should be able to complete in a short amount of time that we can then iterate over to build some further complexity.

Your program should output the result of the calculation via a print statement as shown below:


        .data
array:  .word   894, 437, 694, 788, 302, 189, 842, 557, 257, 222
ofmt:   .asciz  "the average is %d\n"
        .align  2
        .text
        .global main

avg:    stmfd   sp!, {lr}
        // your implementation goes here

        // remember to set r0 to the return result
        ldmfd   sp!, {lr}
        mov     pc, lr

main:   stmfd   sp!, {lr}

        ldr     r0, =array
        mov     r1, #10
        bl      avg

        mov     r1, r0
        ldr     r0, =ofmt
        bl      printf

        mov     r0, #0
        ldmfd   sp!, {lr}
        mov     pc, lr




For the random array of values given the average should be 518.
